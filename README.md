# Protecting-Data
This repository includes a group project i participated in Imperial College London for the course "Privacy Engineering". We applied de-identification techniques to anonymize a dataset that would be released for three use cases. The main goal of the project was to find the right balance between privacy and utility while producing the new anonymized dataset.
